# Project Name:
Peddy - Pet Adoption Website

# Short Description:
Peddy is a responsive pet adoption website designed to help users browse through various pets available for adoption, view detailed information about each pet, and even initiate the adoption process. The platform allows users to filter pets by categories such as cats, dogs, rabbits, and birds, as well as save liked pets for easier reference. The website also has a features like a modal-based adoption countdown and sorting by pet price.

# Key Features of the Project:

Users can filter pets by category (e.g., cats, dogs, rabbits) and view pets based on their selection.

When the "Adopt" button is clicked, a countdown (3, 2, 1) initiates before confirming adoption.

Clicking the "Details" button opens a modal with detailed information about the pet, such as breed, birth date, gender, and price.

Users can like pets by clicking the thumbs-up icon, which adds the pets to a "liked" section where they can view only their favorite pets.

Users can sort the pets based on their price, ensuring they can find pets within their budget.

# ES6 Features Used:

### Arrow Functions:
For shorter and more readable function declarations (e.g., const loadCategories = () => {...}).

### Template Literals:
To create HTML snippets and embed expressions within strings more efficiently (e.g., ${item.category}).

### Let and Const Declarations:
Ensuring proper scoping for variables and avoiding accidental reassignments.

### Promises with Fetch API:
For handling asynchronous requests to APIs (e.g., fetching pet categories and pet details).

### Array Methods (forEach):
Iterating through arrays to render categories and pets in a concise manner.
